## Quick Start

1. [**ML Training
   Pipeline**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/pipeline/):
This is the process to set up standard training pipelines for machine learning
models enabling both immediate experimentation, as well as tracking and
retraining models over time.
2. [**ML Inference
   Pipeline**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/pipeline/):
Deploys a model to be used by the business in production. Currently this is
coupled quite closely to the ML training pipeline as there is a lot of overlap.
3. [**Development
   environment**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/environment/):
This module manages the provisioning of resources and manages networking and
security, providing the environment for data scientists and engineers to
develop solutions.
