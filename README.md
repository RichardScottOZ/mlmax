## Notes on version management

This template hardcodes the version in `setup.py` as the baseline. However, we
strongly recommend [versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer/)
which is also used by some mature projects such as
[pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/).

Follow these [steps](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Misc. notes

Full-blown templates are maintained in branch `feature/fullblown-ds-project`.
